        <h2>About Ron's Small Engine Repair</h2>
        <p class="indent">In the spring of 2021 when the worst cases of Covid-19 was slowly coming to an end, 
          I needed something that would not interact with people up close.
          So small engines came to mind and I am mechanically inclined...perfect,<br></p>
          <p class="indent">I ordered quite a few tools that I needed to make working on small engines easier and better.
          I set up my first website with AWS and it was a learning experience to say the least. Fast forward to 2024, 
          I designed this website (Jan 2024) with the help of AI and use a no-cost web hosting service now.
          I also use a no-cost estimate, invoicing software that is on the cloud that does e-commerce payment to my liking.<br></p>
          <p class="indent">I rebuilt many small engines for customers with excellent results in my 3 years of this business in that I want to make this my forte. 
            Older equipment before 2010 is now harder to get parts for and if my customer really wants their equipment repaired there are alternate ways like China and E-Bay.
            I prefer OEM parts because they usually will give very little or no problems as compared to the knock-off Chinese parts. Most engines and complete units 
             by manufacturing companies are made in China nowadays. 
             I will service or repair small engine equipment that most dealers will turn away because it would cost too much for the repair and they would like you to buy a brand new unit.
             I am strictly into repairing and servicing and do not sell new units. The dealers and "box stores" do a very good job at this.<br><br></p>
             <p class="indent">"We often canâ€™t learn by reading books; it is achieved by
              addressing real world problems and practice, it relates to experience,
              intuition, ideals, creative thinking, emotions, values, skills and attitudes."
